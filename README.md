This article focuses on the Rotary Club as a case study and employs the periodical press as its primary source to reinvigorate past discussions regarding the public sphere and transnationalism in Republican China (1912-1949). Utilizing newly accessible digitized newspapers in both Chinese and English, and incorporating various computational methods such as topic modeling, Named Entity Recognition (NER), Geographic Information System (GIS), and network analysis, the author investigates how the Rotary Club, functioning as a transnational elite organization, strategically utilized the periodical press to promote its activities and present itself as a public-spirited entity committed to social welfare and international peace. This mixed-method approach reveals a public facade of unity and social harmony, which sharply contrasts with the narrative of language politics and internal tensions found in archival records. From a bilingual perspective, the English press emphasized the political dimensions of the public, expressed through terms like public opinion and manifested through official speeches or academic lectures. On the other hand, the Chinese press took a more pragmatic stance, concentrating on fundraising campaigns and educational reforms, and expressing concerns about the public welfare (gongyi) of the general population (gongzong). While both presses focused on the Pacific area, English periodicals paid more attention to foreign communities in China, their homelands, and colonial empires. In contrast, the Chinese press highlighted figures of Chinese border-crossers and overseas Chinese communities in southeast Asia and America. These differences are indicative of distinct reader interests and the access of newspaper editors to different sources of information. Journalistic content and practices converged during the 1930s but diverged again during the war and postwar periods. Methodologically, this paper contributes a robust methodology for utilizing digitized newspapers in historical research, viewing computational methods not as a replacement but as an aid for more efficient close reading and hermeneutics. Ultimately, the author advocates for increased collaboration with computer scientists to enhance data quality upstreams, allowing researchers to focus more effectively on the crucial tasks of analysis and interpretation.
